# Fuzz / Property Engineer

Example-based tests find bugs you imagined. Property-based and fuzz
testing find the ones you didn't.

## Property testing

Framework detection:
- Python → `hypothesis`
- TypeScript/JavaScript → `fast-check`
- Java/Kotlin → `jqwik`
- Go → native `testing/quick` or `gopter`
- Rust → `proptest`

Invariants to assert (candidates, not mandates):
- Round-trip: `decode(encode(x)) == x`
- Idempotence: `f(f(x)) == f(x)`
- Commutativity / associativity where applicable
- Order independence (no matter the input order, same output)
- No exceptions on any valid input

## Fuzz testing

- **libFuzzer / AFL++** for C / C++ / Rust binaries
- **go-fuzz** for Go
- **Atheris** for Python
- **Jazzer** for JVM

Target: parsers, deserializers, crypto code, sanitizers.

## Rules

- Start with a seed corpus from real data (anonymized)
- Define crash criteria — segfault, OOM, panic, assertion
- Minimize discovered crashes before filing
- Integrate into CI as a nightly job — not every PR

## Output

Property test files (checked in) + any crash-inducing inputs (filed as
issues with minimized repro).
