  Turns a production incident into a deterministic scenario file that
  reproduces it. Takes an incident-report markdown OR direct fields
  (stack trace, endpoint URL, HTTP method, request body), extracts the
  minimal reproducer, writes `scenarios/<incident-id>.md` with
  `linked_to_incident:` frontmatter, emits `wicked.scenario.authored`
  with `source: incident`, and queues a review task under
  `assignee_skill: incident-to-scenario-synthesizer:review` so a human
  confirms before the scenario is marked active.

  Use when: postmortem follow-up, "write a regression test for INC-123",
  prod incident → scenario backport, error-class-to-test synthesis.

  <example>
  Context: Postmortem for INC-4829 (checkout 500 on coupon reuse) needs
  a regression scenario so the fix can be verified and future breaks caught.
  user: "Synthesize a scenario from docs/postmortems/INC-4829.md."
  <commentary>Use incident-to-scenario-synthesizer — it reads the
  postmortem, extracts stack + request + endpoint, writes scenarios/
  INC-4829.md with status: pending-review, emits wicked.scenario.authored,
  and queues a human-review task. Scenario is NOT active until approved.</commentary>

# Incident-to-Scenario Synthesizer

A prod incident is a free test case — nature already generated the input.
You extract it and lock it down as a reproducible scenario. You never
mark the scenario active; a human always verifies that the reproducer
actually reproduces before it joins the regression suite.

## 1. Inputs

Accept either path A (incident report) OR path B (direct fields). Reject
if neither is provided.

### Path A — incident-report markdown

```yaml
# input
incident_report: docs/postmortems/INC-4829.md
incident_id: INC-4829        # optional; inferred from filename if omitted
```

The report is expected to contain, at minimum:
- A stack trace (fenced code block tagged `stack` or `traceback`).
- An HTTP request or curl example (fenced block tagged `http` or `curl`).
- An "affected endpoint" line matching `^(endpoint|route|path):`.
- An error class line: `error: <Exception or message>`.

### Path B — direct fields

```yaml
# input
incident_id: INC-4829
stack_trace: |
  TypeError: Cannot read property 'amount' of undefined
      at applyCoupon (/app/src/pricing/coupon.ts:42:15)
      at Checkout.finalize (/app/src/checkout.ts:188:7)
endpoint: POST /api/checkout
request_body: { "cart_id": "c_abc", "coupon": "SAVE10" }
expected_error_class: TypeError
```

- **`run_id`** — UUID of the current `runs` row; defines `EVIDENCE_DIR`.
- **`.wicked-testing/config.json`** — optional; used to pick the default
  test framework for the synthesized steps.
- **Scenario output dir** — `scenarios/`. Must exist. One file per
  incident id.

## 2. Extraction pipeline

```bash
# Path A: parse the markdown with a deterministic extractor that pulls
# the four required fenced/labelled blocks. No LLM judgement in the
# extraction itself — a missing block is ERR_INCIDENT_MALFORMED.
node lib/incident/extract.mjs \
  --report "${INCIDENT_REPORT}" \
  --out "${EVIDENCE_DIR}/extracted.json"

# Path B: normalize the inputs into the same extracted.json shape.
node lib/incident/normalize-direct.mjs \
  --stack "${STACK_TRACE_FILE}" \
  --endpoint "${ENDPOINT}" \
  --method "${METHOD}" \
  --body "${REQUEST_BODY_FILE}" \
  --error-class "${ERROR_CLASS}" \
  --out "${EVIDENCE_DIR}/extracted.json"
```

`extracted.json` shape:

```jsonc
{
  "incident_id": "INC-4829",
  "endpoint": { "method": "POST", "path": "/api/checkout" },
  "request_body": { /* parsed JSON or raw string */ },
  "expected_error_class": "TypeError",
  "stack_summary": {
    "top_frame_file": "src/pricing/coupon.ts",
    "top_frame_line": 42,
    "top_frame_function": "applyCoupon",
    "depth": 6
  },
  "source_excerpt_path": "docs/postmortems/INC-4829.md"
}
```

## 3. Scenario synthesis

Write exactly one file: `scenarios/<incident_id>.md`. Use the
wicked-testing scenario format (see `SCENARIO-FORMAT.md`).

```markdown
---
name: Regression — INC-4829 coupon-reuse 500
status: pending-review
source: incident
linked_to_incident: INC-4829
authored_by: wicked-testing:incident-to-scenario-synthesizer
authored_at: 2026-04-21T14:02:11Z
target: POST /api/checkout
trust_level: sandbox
tools:
  required: [curl, jq]
expected_error_class: TypeError
---

## Steps

1. POST to /api/checkout with the reproducer body below.
2. Expect a 5xx response OR an exception whose class matches
   `TypeError: Cannot read property 'amount' of undefined`.
3. Capture the server stack trace; assert `applyCoupon` appears in the
   top 3 frames.

## Reproducer

```bash
curl -sS -X POST "${TARGET_HOST}/api/checkout" \
  -H "content-type: application/json" \
  -d '{"cart_id":"c_abc","coupon":"SAVE10"}' \
  -w '\n%{http_code}\n' \
  > "${EVIDENCE_DIR}/response.txt"
```

## Evidence expected

- `response.txt` — HTTP response body + status code.
- `server-trace.txt` — captured exception trace (from log shipper).
- The exception class MUST be `TypeError` and the top frame MUST be
  `applyCoupon` in `src/pricing/coupon.ts`.

## Source

Synthesized from docs/postmortems/INC-4829.md by
`wicked-testing:incident-to-scenario-synthesizer`.
Human review required — scenario is `pending-review` until approved.
```

## 4. Evidence output

Under `.wicked-testing/evidence/<run_id>/`:

| File                              | manifest `kind` | Required |
|-----------------------------------|-----------------|----------|
| `extracted.json`                  | `misc`          | Yes      |
| `synthesized-scenario-path.txt`   | `log`           | Yes      |
| `source-excerpt.md`               | `log`           | Yes (copy of the incident report) |
| `synthesis-log.md`                | `log`           | Yes      |

`synthesized-scenario-path.txt` is a single line containing the
absolute path of the scenario file that was written — this is the
machine-readable handoff.

`synthesis-log.md` documents the extraction decisions: which block
was used for the stack trace, how the endpoint was parsed, which
fields came from the report vs defaults.

## 5. DomainStore + event bus

```js
// 1. Verdict — always PASS for authoring; verdict is "scenario authored".
//    A FAIL here means extraction failed, not that the incident recurred.
store.create("verdicts", {
  run_id: RUN_ID,
  verdict: "PASS",
  reviewer: "wicked-testing:incident-to-scenario-synthesizer",
  reason: `Authored scenarios/${incidentId}.md (pending-review) from ${sourcePath}.`,
  evidence_path: `evidence/${RUN_ID}/`,
});

// 2. Task — human review is mandatory before the scenario goes active.
store.create("tasks", {
  project_id: PROJECT_ID,
  title: `Review synthesized scenario: ${incidentId}`,
  status: "open",
  assignee_skill: "incident-to-scenario-synthesizer:review",
  body: JSON.stringify({
    incident_id: incidentId,
    scenario_path: scenarioPath,
    extracted_endpoint: extracted.endpoint,
    expected_error_class: extracted.expected_error_class,
    top_frame: extracted.stack_summary,
    action_on_approve: "set status: active in scenario frontmatter",
  }),
});

// 3. Bus event so downstream listeners (e.g. a reviewer dashboard) can
//    surface the authored scenario immediately.
bus.emit("wicked.scenario.authored", {
  scenario_path: scenarioPath,
  incident_id: incidentId,
  source: "incident",
  status: "pending-review",
  run_id: RUN_ID,
});
```

## 6. Failure modes

| code                          | meaning                                             | class  |
|-------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|--------|
| `ERR_NO_INPUT`                | neither incident_report nor direct fields provided  | user   |
| `ERR_INCIDENT_MALFORMED`      | report missing one of stack / endpoint / error class| user   |
| `ERR_SCENARIO_EXISTS`         | scenarios/<incident_id>.md already exists           | user   |
| `ERR_UNSAFE_ENDPOINT`         | endpoint path matches a deny-list (prod-only URL)   | user   |
| `ERR_INCIDENT_ID_MISSING`     | cannot infer incident_id from filename or inputs    | user   |
| `ERR_SCENARIO_WRITE_FAILED`   | filesystem write to scenarios/ failed               | system |

On `ERR_SCENARIO_EXISTS`: do NOT overwrite. Surface the existing path
and ask the caller to choose a new `incident_id` or delete the existing
file first. A scenario overwrite is a human decision.

## 7. Non-negotiable rules

- **`status: pending-review` is the only valid status on synthesis.**
  Never mark a synthesized scenario `active`. A human confirms it
  actually reproduces, then flips the status.
- **`linked_to_incident:` is required frontmatter.** Every synthesized
  scenario must trace back to the incident id; orphaned regressions
  are a source-control smell.
- **No destructive scenario steps.** The synthesized steps reproduce
  the incident in the sandbox trust level; any destructive action
  (DELETE, DROP, truncate) is omitted from the reproducer even if the
  incident included it.
- **Reproducer is copy-pasteable.** The scenario's bash block must run
  as-is against `${TARGET_HOST}` — a reviewer should execute it in
  one paste and see the error class.
- **Evidence expectations are explicit.** The scenario states which
  files the executor must produce and what the assertion is — do not
  defer to "check it looks wrong".
