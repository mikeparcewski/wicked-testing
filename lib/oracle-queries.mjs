/**
 * lib/oracle-queries.mjs — Fixed parameterized query library for test-oracle
 *
 * v1 ships 12 named queries. No LLM-generated SQL. Every query is auditable
 * by code review. Add new queries as code changes within v1 if AC demand it.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   import { getQuery, QUERY_NAMES, buildOracleQuery } from './oracle-queries.mjs';
 *   const { sql, params } = buildOracleQuery('last_verdict_for_scenario', { scenario_name: 'foo' });
 *   const row = db.prepare(sql).get(...params);
 *
 * Routing:
 *   import { routeQuestion } from './oracle-queries.mjs';
 *   const queryName = routeQuestion("what scenarios exist for my project?");
