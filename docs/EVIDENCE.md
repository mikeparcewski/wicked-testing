# Evidence Store Layout

Evidence is wicked-testing's **proof of work**: the artifacts a test produced
(screenshots, logs, curl output, stack traces) plus a manifest that names the
verdict. This document is the **public contract** for how evidence is stored
and read.

See [INTEGRATION.md](INTEGRATION.md) for how this ties into the bus and brain.

---

## 1. Storage Model

Evidence is always **project-local**:

```
<project-root>/.wicked-testing/
  wicked-testing.db             # SQLite ledger (internal — not a contract)
  evidence/
    <run-id>/                   # one directory per test run (UUID v4)
      manifest.json             # verdict + artifact index  ← PUBLIC CONTRACT
      artifacts/
        <name>.<ext>            # screenshots, logs, outputs, traces
```

No home-global store. A project's full test history lives beside its code and
is portable by directory copy.

## 2. `manifest.json` Schema (public)

### Field rules

| Field                 | Required | Notes                                                |
|-----------------------|----------|------------------------------------------------------|
| `manifest_version`    | yes      | Semver. Bumped on any schema-breaking change.        |
| `run_id`              | yes      | UUID v4. Matches the bus event `run_id`.             |
| `project_id`          | yes      | UUID v4. Matches the bus event `project_id`.         |
| `scenario_id`         | yes      | UUID v4.                                             |
| `scenario_name`       | yes      | Human-readable identifier.                           |
| `scenario_path`       | no       | Present when scenario came from a file.              |
| `started_at`          | yes      | ISO 8601 UTC with `Z`.                               |
| `finished_at`         | yes      | ISO 8601 UTC with `Z`.                               |
| `duration_ms`         | yes      | Integer milliseconds.                                |
| `status`              | yes      | `passed | failed | partial | inconclusive | errored | skipped`. |
| `verdict.value`       | yes      | `PASS | FAIL | PARTIAL | CONDITIONAL | INCONCLUSIVE | N-A | SKIP`.  |
| `verdict.reviewer`    | yes      | Dispatch name of the reviewer skill that judged (e.g. `wicked-testing:acceptance-test-reviewer`; same string as the former agent `subagent_type`). |
| `verdict.reason`      | when FAIL/N-A/SKIP | Free text. ≤ 500 chars recommended.        |
| `verdict.equivalence` | no       | Optional baseline-match facet. When both `diff_count` and `tolerance` are present, the producer guarantees the invariant `matched === (diff_count <= tolerance)`; a contradictory facet is dropped rather than recorded. |
| `environment.*`       | yes      | Best-effort capture at run start.                    |
| `artifacts[]`         | yes      | Empty array allowed for `skipped`.                   |
| `artifacts[].kind`    | yes      | See table below.                                     |
| `artifacts[].sha256`  | yes      | Integrity. Readers may verify before trusting.       |
| `assertions[]`        | no       | Present when scenario had explicit assertions.       |

### Artifact kinds

| Kind             | Typical content                            |

| `http-request`   | Method + URL + headers + body              |
| `log`            | Plain text log lines                       |
| `stack-trace`    | Exception / stack dump                     |
| `metric`         | Perf or coverage sample                    |
| `trace`          | OpenTelemetry JSON                         |

## 3. Evidence Directory Rules

1. **Immutable after verdict.** Once `verdict.recorded_at` is written, nothing
   in the directory may change. Corrections are recorded as a new run.
2. **Self-contained.** A run directory can be zipped and shared; consumers
   should not need the project's database to read it.
3. **Artifact paths are relative** to `manifest.json`. Absolute paths are
   forbidden.
4. **`sha256`** is hex-encoded, 64 chars, lowercase.
5. **Writable by wicked-testing only.** External tools should write alongside,
   not inside, the run directory.

---

## 4. Retention

Default retention: **unbounded** (evidence is cheap; deletion is a human
decision). wicked-testing provides a prune command but never prunes
automatically.

```
npx wicked-testing prune --older-than 90d          # dry-run by default
npx wicked-testing prune --older-than 90d --apply  # actually delete
npx wicked-testing prune --keep-failed             # keep all FAIL verdicts
```

Bus event is emitted when a run directory is pruned
(`wicked.evidence.pruned`, tier-1 IDs only).

---

## 5. How Consumers Read Evidence

### Normal path (via bus event)

1. Subscribe to `wicked.test.verdict.created` (domain: `wicked-testing`).
2. Read `evidence_path` from the payload.
3. Open `<evidence_path>/manifest.json`.
4. Iterate `artifacts[]`, optionally verify `sha256`.

### Direct query (without bus)

Consumers may scan `<project-root>/.wicked-testing/evidence/*/manifest.json`
directly. This is supported and stable. SQLite access is **not** stable.

### What NOT to read

- The SQLite `wicked-testing.db` file (schema can change across minor versions).
- Any file under `.wicked-testing/` except `evidence/*/manifest.json` and the
  artifacts it indexes.

---

## 6. Multi-Run Queries

For "has this scenario passed recently?" / "flake rate" style queries, use the
`test-oracle` via `/wicked-testing:insight <question>` or `npx wicked-testing
oracle <question>`. It dispatches to fixed SQL that treats the ledger as an
internal index — consumers get stable answers without depending on the schema.

---

## 7. Compatibility

- `manifest_version` follows semver.
- Minor bumps add optional fields. Major bumps change or remove fields.
- Readers should ignore unknown fields for forward compatibility.
- The path structure (`<project-root>/.wicked-testing/evidence/<run-id>/`) is
  stable across minor versions.

### Additive-field policy (and what strict consumers must expect)

The manifest — including the nested `verdict` object — grows **additively**:

- A **minor** `manifest_version` bump (e.g. `1.0.0` → `1.1.0`, which added the
  optional `verdict.equivalence` facet) only ever **adds optional fields**. No
  existing field is renamed, retyped, or removed.
- Only a **major** bump may change or remove a field.

`schemas/evidence.json` declares `additionalProperties: false` on the manifest
and on `verdict`. That constraint is a **producer-integrity guard** — it keeps
wicked-testing from silently emitting undocumented keys — **not** a contract
that downstream validators should mirror unchanged. A strict external validator
that vendors a copy of the schema and enforces `additionalProperties: false`
will **falsely reject** a manifest from a newer producer the moment a new
optional field is introduced (exactly what would happen to a `1.0.0`-schema
consumer seeing a `1.1.0` payload carrying `equivalence`).

**Minimum expectation for a strict / vendored-schema consumer:**

1. **Gate on `manifest_version`.** Read the major version; accept any payload
   whose major matches the schema you hold. A higher *minor* is forward-
   compatible — process it, do not reject it.
2. **Ignore unknown fields.** Either relax `additionalProperties` to `true`
   (or remove it) in your vendored copy, or run your validator in a mode that
   warns-but-passes on extra keys. Never hard-fail on an unrecognized field
   below a matching major version.
3. **Only fail closed on a major-version mismatch** or a missing/invalid
   *required* field — never on the mere presence of an additive optional field.

The internal producer validator (`validateShape` in `wicked-ledger`'s manifest module)
deliberately checks required fields + known-field types and does **not** reject
unknown keys, so it already follows this same additive contract; the published
`additionalProperties: false` is retained purely to keep the producer's own
output honest.
